> Version ~0.0.17 is for Vue 2 usage in CodeIgniter 4 application

Introduction
------------

A CodeIgniter 4 Skeleton Application with Vue.js integration.

Features
--------

- SPA application with Vue Router with cached pages after visited.
- Using server side template from CodeIgniter 4, compiled with `Vue.compile()` in Vue.js component's `render()`.
- Using Vuex for state management library, combo with sessionStorage on portfolio page.
- Webpack support for [production](#production)

## Setup

*1.* Run composer create-project command:

```bash
composer create-project samsonasik/ci4-vue
```

*2.* Copy file `ci4-vue/env` to `ci4-vue/.env`:

```bash
cp ci4-vue/env ci4-vue/.env
```

*3.* Set environment and app configuration

Open `ci4-vue/.env` and set `CI_ENVIRONMENT`, `app.baseURL`, `app.indexPage`:

```bash
# file ci4-vue/.env
CI_ENVIRONMENT = development

app.baseURL    = 'http://localhost:8080'
app.indexPage  = ''
```

*4.* Run PHP Development server

```php
# go to ci4-vue directory
cd ci4-vue

# run php development server inside ci4-vue directory
php spark serve
```

*5.* Open web browser http://localhost:8080

## Production

For deploy to production purpose, it has `webpack.config.js` in root directory that when we run `webpack` command, we can get `public/js/dist/bundle.js` after run it. If you don't have a `webpack` installed yet in your system, you can install nodejs and install `webpack` and `webpack-cli`:

```bash
sudo npm install -g webpack
sudo npm install -g webpack-cli
```

So, we can run:

```bash
webpack

    | ./public/js/store.js 183 bytes [built]
    | ./public/js/portfolio-store-module.js 353 bytes [built]
```

After it generated, we can update `.env` file as follow:

```bash
# file .env
CI_ENVIRONMENT = production

app.baseURL    = 'https://www.your-website.com'
app.indexPage  = ''
```

In `app/Views/layout.php`, we have a `ENVIRONMENT` check to use `js/app.js` when on development, and use `/js/dist/bundle.js` on production when exists.

```php
// src/App/templates/layout/default.phtml
<?php $isDevelopment = ENVIRONMENT === 'development'; ?>

// ...
    <script src="<?php echo base_url($isDevelopment
            ? '/js/app.js'
            : (
                // when after run webpack, allow to use bundled js
                // fallback to use /js/app.js when not
                file_exists(ROOTPATH . 'public/js/dist/bundle.js')
                    ? '/js/dist/bundle.js'
                    : '/js/app.js'
            )) ?>" type="module"></script>
// ...
```

that will automatically take care of that.
